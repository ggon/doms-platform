• make ability to send other users workouts
	• use-case for this is for coaches to send them to their client
• add weights -- will have to tie these to reps (ex. 4 sets of 10 reps @ 45 lbs)
• add time based exercises (running, planks, etc.)
• add supersets [CHECK!]
• add time in between exercises -- rest in between sets AND exercises... maybe punt on this one for now
• add notes section (be careful with this as you don't want to make a free database)
• change Workout to Routine, and Exercise to Workout. That seems appropriate.
• need a better name for Cadence though, is there even a name for this!?!
• add login support through either Facebook or Google, or both. Find differences.
